🔄 Project Flow (Step by Step)
1. User Entry Point (register.html)
The user opens register.html (your welcome file in web.xml).

This page has a form with fields: name, email, mobile.

When submitted, the form sends a POST request to /register.

2. Servlet Mapping (web.xml)
In web.xml, /register is mapped to RegisterServlet.

So the request goes to RegisterServlet.doPost().

3. RegisterServlet.java
Reads form data using req.getParameter("name"), etc.

Creates a Student object and sets values.

Calls StudentDAO.writeStudent(s) to save the student in the database.

After saving, redirects the user to success.jsp.

4. Student.java (Entity Class)
Annotated with @Entity and @Table(name="students").

Represents the students table in MySQL.

Hibernate uses this class to map Java objects to database rows.

5. StudentDAO.java
Handles database operations using Hibernate.

writeStudent(Student s):

Loads hibernate.cfg.xml.

Opens a Hibernate Session.

Begins a transaction.

Persists the Student object into the students table.

Commits transaction.

getAllStudents():

Opens a Hibernate session.

Runs query from Student (HQL).

Returns a List<Student> with all rows from the table.

6. success.jsp
After registration, user sees confirmation: “Student Registered Successfully!”

Provides links to go back to registration or view all students.

7. ViewStudentsServlet.java
Mapped to /view in web.xml.

When user clicks “View All Students”, request goes to /view.

Servlet calls StudentDAO.getAllStudents().

Stores the list in req.setAttribute("studentList", lst).

Forwards request to viewStudents.jsp.

8. viewStudents.jsp
Retrieves studentList from request.

Iterates over each Student object.

Displays them in an HTML table (ID, Name, Email, Mobile).

Provides link to register another student.

9. hibernate.cfg.xml
Defines database connection (MySQL dac schema).

Maps com.cdac.Student entity.

Configures Hibernate behavior (update, show_sql).

10. error.html
A fallback page in case registration fails.

Provides link to retry registration.

🚀 How to Start Writing This Project
Start with the Entity (Student.java) → defines your DB structure.

Configure Hibernate (hibernate.cfg.xml) → connects Java to MySQL.

Write DAO (StudentDAO.java) → handles DB operations.

Create Servlets (RegisterServlet, ViewStudentsServlet) → handle requests.

Design JSP/HTML pages (register.html, success.jsp, viewStudents.jsp) → user interface.

Map everything in web.xml → connects URLs to Servlets.

🛠️ Step‑by‑Step Flow
1. Start with the Frontend (Entry Point)
- File: register.html
- Role: User interface for registration.
- Action: User fills in name, email, mobile → submits form.
- Connection: Form action points to /register → mapped in web.xml to RegisterServlet.

2. Servlet Controller (RegisterServlet)
- File: RegisterServlet.java
- Role: Controller that handles POST request.
- Action:
- Reads form data (req.getParameter).
- Creates a Student object.
- Calls StudentDAO.writeStudent(s) to persist.
- Connection: Talks to DAO layer for DB operations. Redirects to success.jsp on success, error.html on failure.

3. Model (Entity Class)
- File: Student.java
- Role: Represents DB table students.
- Action: Hibernate maps this class to table columns.
- Connection: Used by DAO for persistence and queries.

4. DAO Layer (Database Access)
- File: StudentDAO.java
- Role: Encapsulates DB logic using Hibernate.
- Action:
- writeStudent(Student s) → saves student.
- getAllStudents() → fetches all students.
- Connection: Uses hibernate.cfg.xml for DB connection. Returns data to Servlets.

5. Hibernate Configuration
- File: hibernate.cfg.xml
- Role: Defines DB connection, dialect, schema update, mapped classes.
- Connection: Loaded by DAO to build SessionFactory.

6. Success and Error Views
- Files: success.jsp, error.html
- Role: Feedback to user.
- Action:
- Success → shows confirmation + links.
- Error → shows failure message + retry link.
- Connection: Redirected from RegisterServlet.

7. View Students Flow
- File: ViewStudentsServlet.java
- Role: Controller for viewing all students.
- Action:
- Calls StudentDAO.getAllStudents().
- Sets list in request attribute.
- Forwards to viewStudents.jsp.
- Connection: URL /view mapped in web.xml.

8. View Students JSP
- File: viewStudents.jsp
- Role: Displays student list in table.
- Action: Iterates over studentList attribute.
- Connection: Data comes from ViewStudentsServlet.

9. Deployment Descriptor
- File: web.xml
- Role: Maps URLs to servlets, defines welcome files.
- Connection: Ensures /register → RegisterServlet, /view → ViewStudentsServlet.

🚀 Where to Start Writing Code
- Model First (Student.java)
- Define your entity class with Hibernate annotations.
- This ensures DB mapping is ready.
- DAO Layer (StudentDAO.java)
- Write methods for persistence (writeStudent) and retrieval (getAllStudents).
- Test DAO independently with a simple main() before wiring servlets.
- Hibernate Config (hibernate.cfg.xml)
- Set up DB connection, dialect, and mapping.
- Verify schema auto‑creation in MySQL.
- Servlets (RegisterServlet, ViewStudentsServlet)
- Controllers that connect UI → DAO.
- Add error handling to redirect to error.html.
- JSP/HTML Views (register.html, success.jsp, viewStudents.jsp, error.html)
- Build user interface.
- Ensure form actions and links match servlet mappings.
- web.xml
- Wire everything together with URL mappings.
- Set welcome file to register.html.

✅ Summary
- Start coding with the model (Student.java) → then DAO → then Hibernate config → then Servlets → then JSP/HTML views → finally wire in web.xml.
- The flow is MVC style:
- View (HTML/JSP) → Controller (Servlets) → Model/DAO (Hibernate + DB) → back to View.
- error.html is your fallback page for exceptions.

Rushikesh, since you’re building this as a Library Management System, you can repeat this same pattern for Books, Issues, Returns:
- Create entity classes (Book, Issue, etc.),
- DAO methods,
- Servlets for each action,
- JSPs for views.
